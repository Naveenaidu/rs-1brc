There are different ways to read the file, we might have to compare their performance.

Testing:
-> Comparing the diff will not work
-> Read through the .out file spit by program and the test file and then compare 
   the hashmap.

-> A program, which takes a file and gives us back a hashmap

TODO:
1. Write the values to file -> With one round off digit
2. Write the code for test case to compare the values with the *.out file
    -> We can just read the *.out file into a hashmap
    -> We can then compare the hashmap
3. Code to write the result to the file


TODO:

tests failing for measurements-20.txt -> FIX THIS -> DONE
